## ‚úÖ Getting Started

Clone the repository and choose the folder/language you need:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtarkington-dev/code-templates.git
cd code-templates
```

Then navigate to the script or agent you want to use.

---

## üìä Agent Use (Python)

If you're using the agents:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install openai pandas requests streamlit rich
```

2. Run an agent:

```python
from automation.task_runner_agent import TaskRunnerAgent
result = TaskRunnerAgent().run("Build a simple backup system")
print(result)
```

3. Integrate agents into a Streamlit dashboard or CLI.

For architecture details, see `agent_architecture.md`.
