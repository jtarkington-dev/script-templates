# JavaScript Utility Templates

This folder contains a curated set of JavaScript utility modules for browser-based development and frontend tooling. Each script is written in clean ES6+ syntax, well-documented, and designed to drop directly into your project.

Whether you're working with user input, DOM manipulation, local storage, or building frontend tools, these utilities are designed to solve the common headaches fast.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

All scripts are written in plain ES6+ JavaScript and work in modern browsers.

### üåü No External Dependencies

You don‚Äôt need to install anything. These scripts are 100% standalone. Just import them into your HTML or ES module setup:

```html
<script type="module">
  import copyToClipboard from "./clipboard_util.js";
  copyToClipboard("Hello, world!");
</script>
```

Or attach them to a `<script type="module">` in your project.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Use Cases

- **`debounce_function.js`**: Add to any search box or input listener
- **`form_serializer.js`**: Submit full forms as JSON to APIs or save states
- **`dom_logger.js`**: Great for web dashboards, console mirroring, or AI UI overlays
- **`event_delegate.js`**: Efficient listener for dynamic UIs (e.g., a todo list)
- **`throttle_function.js`**: Smooth scroll performance handlers

## üîÑ Why These Exist

Frontend apps often repeat the same small tasks: copying to clipboard, throttling scroll events, debouncing input, storing JSON safely. These templates give you a head start:

- No libraries or frameworks required
- Browser-safe and optimized
- Built from practical, repeat-use patterns

These aren‚Äôt generic snippets ‚Äî they‚Äôre purpose-built for real frontend work.
