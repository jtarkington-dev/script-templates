# PowerShell Script Templates

This folder contains a collection of practical PowerShell script templates focused on system administration, automation, and Windows task routines. These scripts are production-ready, reusable, and designed to minimize boilerplate when you're automating common admin tasks.

Whether you're backing up files, checking services, exporting system info, or cleaning up old data ‚Äî these scripts let you focus on execution, not syntax.
